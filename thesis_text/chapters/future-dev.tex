\section*{To be studied$\ldots$}%
\label{ch:future:to-be-studied}%

Following up the current status of the project, the next steps includes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finalization details of Boltzmann Machines, such as the update equations of the state of a unit and the description of the BM algorithm.
  \item Studying Restricted Boltzmann Machines and how its learning algorithm works.
  \item Dummy test to compare results of Hopfield, Boltzmann Machine and Restricted Boltzmann Machine
  \item Identify an interesting problem where the application of RBM is suitable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Chronogram}%
\label{ch:future:chronogram}

Aiming to conclude this masters dissertation the chronogram below seems to be the most coherent:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalization of both Boltzmann and Restricted Boltzmann Machines by the end of \textbf{January 2020}.
  \item Definition of the case to apply RBM by the end of \textbf{January 2020}.
  \item Implementation and testing of RBM algorithm to solve proposed task by the end of \textbf{May 2020}.
  \item Meanwhile keep with the development of the written text in parallel which will take up to about \textbf{June 2020}.
\end{itemize}
