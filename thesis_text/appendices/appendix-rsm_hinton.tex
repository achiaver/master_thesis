\section{Replicated Softmax Model}%
\label{app:rsm}%

(CITAR RUSLAN E HINTON) proposed the Replicated Softmax to model and extract low-dimensional latent semantic representations of an unstructured collection of documents. 

Within Natural Language Processing research field it is possible to access the topic a document based on its words probability distribution, this is known as Topic Modelling. 

Replicated Softmax model uses a Restricted Boltzmann Machine structure.
