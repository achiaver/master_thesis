\label{ch:future:to-be-studied}%

Following up the current status of the project, the next steps includes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A deeper understanding of the Restricted Boltzmann Machines and how its learning algorithm works. 
    Also

  \item Find a proper contextt where the RBM can be applied and tested.
\end{enumerate}
