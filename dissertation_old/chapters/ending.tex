% \paragraph{Future directions}
% (para versão final da tese)
% Levantar aspectos futuros a desenvolver. Por exemplo, se o medidor da concessionária fosse integrado à blockchain, essa coleta de dados poderia ser totalmente automatizada (trustless), evitando qualquer necessidade de uma autoridade central na associação. Na verdade, a própria concessionária poderia intermediar todo o processo, e aí seria como uma CCEE interna (como você sempre comenta).


% Surely, the proposed model is not exhaustive and must be complemented with and questioned by peers.
% Hopefully, it will contribute to an interdisciplinary audience with helpful explanation of the sector in a broad sense and incentivize the integration of blockchain as well.

As previously presented on the NEO specifications, the NEO platform does not charge for any inner application transaction,
however it can be changed in the future and compromise the \gls{dapp} behaviour because, based on the current development, the user who starts a transaction is responsible to pay the fee by default.
Although another smart contract could be developed to track every time a transaction happens in order to reward the user by the fee payment, this new smart contract will have another fee anyway.
So, a function to handle this should be implemented in future improvements of the smart contracts.

% Therefore, the conditions to share costs and benefits are immeasurable and can raise suspicion in every step.
% In addition, the current data management systems can overwhelm the group investment towards a lower tariff.
% A blockchain application can handle these issues in a more affordable way...

% Besides that, they should take care of their private key, even though a copy of each one can be stored off-chain with restricted access from the representative board under the group guidelines (\emph{point of failure}).
%------- This is a common problem of every blockchain application. Must be a discussion point, not a particular feature.

the \gls{mtemsm} is the boundary between the group independence to manager its shares with its commitment to notify the stakeholders about any change that could happen in the quota values.
This smart contract represents the trade-off between private and public decisions, however certain that its more transparent and secure to hold these pieces of information on the blockchain, instead to leave this responsibility for the power utility.
